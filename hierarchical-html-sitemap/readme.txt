A lightweight and simple HTML sitemap for your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Hierarchical HTML Sitemap offers visitors an easy and intuitive navigation across your blog.

This plugin generates HTML Sitemap of your WordPress blog. It displays a list of posts, grouped by hierarchically sorted categories. By using a shortcode you can easily and quickly display sitemap on a page, or anywhere where shortcodes work, e.g. in a widget.

The output does not include any CSS or JavaScript files - it is pure HTML, ready for you to style as you want it.
